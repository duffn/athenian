# athenian

A Ruby library for interacting with the [Athenian](https://athenian.co) API.

## Generation

This library is automatically generated by [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech).

The version number of this gem corresponds to a tag in the [Athenian OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/athenianco/api-spec) repository.

- Files in [`docs`](docs), [`lib`](lib), and [`spec`](spec) are generated from the [Athenian OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/athenianco/api-spec).
- Files in [`generator`](generator) are the scripts and supplemental files used to generate the library.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```
bundle add athenian
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```
gem install athenian
```

## Getting Started

```ruby
require 'athenian'

Athenian.configure do |config|
  # Configure Bearer authorization from https://app.athenian.co/bearer
  config.access_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'
  # Configure a proc to get access tokens in lieu of the static access_token configuration
  config.access_token_getter = -> { 'YOUR TOKEN GETTER PROC' }
end

# Example
api_instance = Athenian::AlignApi.new
opts = {
  body: Athenian::GoalTemplateCreateRequest.new({account: 37, metric: Athenian::JIRAMetricID::OPEN, name: 'Untitled Template'})
}

begin
  #ðŸ‘¤ Create a goal template.
  result = api_instance.create_goal_template(opts)
  p result
rescue Athenian::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling AlignApi->create_goal_template: #{e}"
end
```

## Documentation

- See the [docs](docs) directory for comprehensive library docs and examples.
- Also see the interactive [Athenian API browser](https://api.athenian.co/v1/ui/).

## Tests

Autogenerated tests are in the [`spec`](spec) directory.

Be very wary of what the tests currently provide. Autogenerated tests from the OpenAPI generator generally have empty bodies.
